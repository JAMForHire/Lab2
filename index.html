              This section has 3 clauses. The 1st clause (known as the "Privileges and Immunities Clause") states that citizens of each
              State are entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in every other state.
              The 2nd clause (known as the "Extradition Clause") states that a person charged in any State with any crime that flees
              from that State to another State is required to be delivered back to the State the person comitted the crime in order to
              face jurisdiction.
              The 3rd clause (known as the "Fugitive Slate Clause") states the same thing as the 2nd clause, except it pertains to
              persons that are considered fugitives from slavery.
