            <p>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</p>

            <p>
              This article establishes the process of amending the Constitution. In order to propose an Amendment, either two-thirds of
              the House of Representatives in Congress are required to be in agreement or two-thirds of the State Legislatures have to
              call a Convention to propose Amendments. Either of these requirements makes an Amendment valid. In order for Amendments to
              actually amend the Constitution, they need to be ratified by either three-fourths of the State Legislatures or State
              Conventions. There are 2 limits to what the Amendments can propose, however: 1) No Amendment made before the year 1808 can
              affect the 1st and 4th clauses in Section 9 of Article 1 (clause 1 prohibits the federal government from limiting
              the import of slaves prior to the year 1808 and clause 4 limit how taxes can be imposed by the federal government); and 2)
              No Amendment can change the equal number of Senators a State can have.
