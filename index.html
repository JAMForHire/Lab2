              All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.
              This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
              The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              The first clause of this article states that all debts and engagements that the United States entered into under the
              Articles of Confederation will still be valid even when the Constitution gets adopted.
              The second clause of this article is known as the "Supremacy Clause" as it establishes the Constitution, federal laws, and
              federal treaties as the "supreme Law of the Land". What this means is that the Constitution, any federal law enacted by the
              federal government, and any treaty enacted by the federal government are superior to anything within state Constitutions
              and state laws. Judges in every state are also fully bound to the Constitution, federal laws, and federal treaties.
              The third clause of this article is known as the "No Religious Test Clause" states that, while Senators, Representatives,
              members of several State Legislatures, all executive officers, and all judicial officers (both of the federal government
              and state governments) are required (by Oath or Affirmation) to support the Constitution, no religious test shall ever be
              required as a qualification for any of these positions.
