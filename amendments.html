                The Fifth Amendment outlines the basic ideas of jury and judicial process. It is divided into many
                parts. First, it outlines that in criminal trials, the right to a grand jury. It then establishes 
                and forbids the idea of Double Jeopardy (same offence twice in a case against someone). It then 
                establishes the idea of Due Process and the Due Process of Law (fair treatment in the judicial system).

                In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public 
                trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have 
                been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to

                The Sixth Amendment outlines the rights to people in criminal trials. It states that
                there can be a public trial, a right to an attorney, an impartial jury, and to know 
                the evidence or nature of the case. This is a cornerstone of the current judicial 
                system.

                In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, 
                the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be

                Like the sixth amendment, the Seventh Amendment outlines cases, but in this case 
                outlines the civil cases. It confirms that in civil cases there will also be a jury, 
                and also follows the same idea of due process and common law as the sixth amendment.

                Staying along the lines of cases and the judicial process, the Eighth Amendment 
                establishes the idea of preventing any unjust punishments. It creates a fairness in 
                the judicial process, and keeps the end results of cases fit the decision that the jury 
                comes to. It's basically establishing the idea of "the punishment fits the crime".

                The Tenth Amendment outlines the default power structure in the United States. 
                The Federal Government itself only has whatever powers it has been granted, but
                that is not every power that exists. Any power that was not explicitly stated, by 
                default, is granted to the state level government, not the federal government. This
                basically ensured states rights, and creating this default was made to prevent any 
                ambiguity in the future.
